# Kubernetes fundamentals
As an enduser, you have 3 ways to instruct K8S cluster
1. CLI
2. API
3. GUI

when you send a request "ex: kubectl run pod -nginx --image=nginx", you are requesting K8S to run a new pod "record of intent" 
You don't have to worry about anything else since kubernetes will manage the placement, operation functionality status, maintainance, and the monitoring of this container
